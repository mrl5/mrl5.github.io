Welcome to my personal site! My name is Jakub but people often call me Kuba.

I'm a software engineer and a long time open source enthusiast. I specialize in
building robust and scalable backend applications. I have experience in both
cloud and on-premise environments. On top of that I'm comfortable with DevOps
and GNU/Linux SysAdmin related tasks.

## Expertise

I'm proficient with technology listed below, however I'm always eager to learn
new things and further deepen my knowledge!

## Background

My hacking journey started with writing a mIRC bot (deployed on QuakeNet) and
setting up dual-boot for Windows XP and Gentoo Linux - I started early enough to
remember the LILO bootloader ;).

I have Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. My thesis (and project)
involved topics related to condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of
electrical motors, digital signal processing as well as electronic circuit and
PCB design. If you want to learn more, check https://github.com/mrl5/fourier.

I've also finished postgraduate studies in Software Engineering. You can check
a group project, where I was responsible for backend and infra at:
